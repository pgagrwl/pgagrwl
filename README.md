# Hi there, I'm Prayag Agrawal - aka @pgagrwl ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
I am a seasoned Blockchain Engineer with over 4 years of industry experience, holding a track record of leading-edge solutions in blockchain applications, smart contracts, NFTs, and DeFi technologies. My career is marked by a commitment to innovation, security enhancement, and translating intricate requirements into practical blockchain solutions. With a proven history of driving project success at companies like Integraate Innovations and Zebpay, I pride myself on continuous learning and achieving excellence within the blockchain realm.

## Skills and Technologies
My technical toolkit encompasses a robust set of languages, frameworks, and blockchain technologies, including:
- **Languages & Frameworks**: Solidity, JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, MongoDB, Express.js
- **Blockchain & Web3**: EVM, Hardhat, Web3.js, Ethers.js, OpenZeppelin, Chainlink Oracles, The Graph, IPFS
- **Testing & Documentation**: Jest, Mocha, Chai, Swagger Documentation

I leverage these tools to build and secure advanced blockchain solutions, focusing on efficiency, security, and user engagement.

## What I'm Focusing On
As a Blockchain Engineer deeply immersed in the world of smart contracts and decentralized applications, my current focus areas include:
- **Smart Contract Development and Security**: Crafting advanced smart contracts with a keen focus on security and efficiency. Utilizing Solidity and Hardhat, I aim to develop contracts that not only meet but exceed the industry standards for security, thereby contributing to the trustworthiness and reliability of blockchain applications.
- **Smart Contract Auditing**: Rigorously auditing and testing smart contracts to identify and rectify vulnerabilities, ensuring the highest level of security. My approach combines automated tools with manual review processes to provide comprehensive audits that protect against both known threats and emerging vulnerabilities.
- **DApp Development**: Designing and deploying decentralized applications (DApps) that offer seamless user experiences while maintaining the integrity and security of blockchain transactions. My work involves closely integrating smart contracts with user-friendly front-end interfaces, emphasizing intuitive navigation and robust functionality.
- **Blockchain Technology Innovation**: Constantly exploring cutting-edge technologies within the blockchain ecosystem to integrate into projects. This includes experimenting with Layer 2 solutions, cross-chain interoperability, and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols to push the boundaries of what's possible within the blockchain domain.
- **Education and Continuous Learning**: Staying at the forefront of blockchain technology and smart contract security through continuous learning. This involves participating in advanced training, workshops, and mentorship programs to both deepen my knowledge and contribute back to the community by sharing insights and best practices.

As I continue to expand my expertise, I'm always on the lookout for new technologies and methodologies to further refine my skills and contribute to the blockchain community.
